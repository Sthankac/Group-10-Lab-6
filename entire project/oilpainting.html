<p>
Oil paint is a combination of a pigment and an oil binding medium. It dries slowly in comparison to other paints, allowing the artist to manipulate the paint. The binder is usually linseed oil. 
The methods used to process the oil affect the colour, consistency and drying time of the paint.
Colors are classified by three properties: hue, purity and value terms 
that are often misunderstood. Experimenting with a graphics program will get
 the distinctions into your head, though colors mix differently on screen.
</p>
<p>Color theory is an immensely complicated subject, and is 
understood differently by scientists, printers, web designers and painters.
 Subtractive color (where mixing the hues will create black) is what
 oil painters generally use, and some grasp of the theory will help you 
understand about it.</p>
