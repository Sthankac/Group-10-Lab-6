<h2 style="font-size:200%;">Sketches by Shilpa</h2>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Sketches are drawings executed 
with an instrument composed of graphite enclosed 
in a wood casing and intended either as a sketch for a more 
elaborate work in another medium, an exercise in visual
 expression, or a finished work.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:200%;">Digital Paintings by Mereena</h3>

<p style="font-size:120%;">Digital painting is an emerging art form in which traditional 
painting techniques such as watercolor, oils, impasto, etc. are applied 
using digital tools by means of a computer, a graphics tablet and 
stylus, and software.In most digital painting programs, the users 
can create their own brush style using a combination of texture and shape.

<h4 style="font-size:200%;">Oil Paintings by Akhil</h4> 

<p style="font-size:120%;">Oil painting is the process of painting with 
pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used 
drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, 
walnut oil, and safflower oil.Oil paint eventually became the
 principal medium used for creating artworks as its advantages became 
widely known. Oil paint is usually mixed with linseed oil, artist
 grade mineral spirits, or other solvents to make the paint
 thinner, faster or slower-drying.A basic rule of oil paint
 application is 'fat over lean', meaning that each additional layer of
 paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying. 
If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack 
and peel.</p>
